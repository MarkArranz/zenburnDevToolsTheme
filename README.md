## Zenburn Color Scheme for Chrome/Chromium DevTools

Zenburn is a color scheme initially created for the Vim text editor by Jani Nurminen in 2002. It was designed as an ideal theme to be used when working in dark environments and low light situations.

Since its inception, zenburn has gone on to be one of the most popular themes for Vim and has been ported for use in other IDEs and text editors.

This is the Chrome DevTools adaptation of the zenburn theme.
